## Overview

The application is an AI-powered meeting notes summarizer and sharer.

How it Works
You should be able to upload a text transcript (e.g., meeting notes, call transcript).


You should also be able to input a custom instruction/prompt (e.g., “Summarize in bullet points for executives” or “Highlight only action items”).


After clicking on “Generate Summary”, the AI should generate a structured summary based on the prompt.


The generated summary should be editable.


Once edits are made, the user should be able to share the summary via email by entering recipient addresses.
